This year, Accuvant sponsored the annual Plaid CTF event. It is one of our favorite events of the year for several reasons. First, we believe heavily in the lessons that these exercises teach. The time limits bring a motivating pressure; the result of which is often amazing feats of hacking to be remembered for years to come. Solving challenges teaches you new things and/or reinforces existsing knowledge. We've been consistently impressed with the PPP team and the CTF events they have put on for the past several years. We were extatic to contribute and even took on several of the challenges ourselves. What follows is a close look at the second highest value explotiation challenge from the event.
</p>

<h1>The Challenge</h1>
<p>
Name: harry_potter<br />
Category: Pwnables<br />
Point Value: 300 (was doubled from 150 during the game)<br />
Description:
</p>
<br />
<p class="c6"><i>
If only we could get into <a href="http://play.plaidctf.com/files/harry_potter-2e0391597fb1d20ebf79b7d77c21b06e.tar.bz2">this system</a>,
running at 54.198.150.4:666, we might get an idea of where The Plague as been keeping the Prime Factorizer.
</i></p>
<br />
<p>
As we can see from the description, the provided challenge program was listening for us on a TCP port on a remote machine. No other access was provided to said machine. However, the organizers graciously linked to a binary to examine.
</p>

<h1>Digging into the Binary</h1>
<p>
Opening the binary with IDA Pro showed it was an ELF64 binary for Linux. As such, we didn't have a decompiler handy. Our appetite for assembly was healthy anyway, so we pushed forward. Digging deeper, we quickly located the <i>main</i>
function by inspecting the arguments to the call to <i>__libc_start_main</i>, shown below.
The argument was originally a <i>loc_XXX</i> style name, but we renamed it to <i>main</i> and navigated to it first thing.
</p>
<br />

</span>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<p>
After following the <i>main</i> cross-reference, converting the destination instructions to a procedure, and turning on graph mode, we saw the first basic block as follows:
</p>
<br />
<p>
<span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 680.00px; height: 114.00px;">
<img alt="the first basic block of main" src="images/image01.png" style="width: 680.00px; height: 114.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="the first basic block of main">
</span>
</p>
<p>
Figure 2. the first basic block of <i>main</i>
</p>
<br />
<p>
The <i>main </i> function starts by using the <i>cerr iostream</i> to display a message. Following that, it calls a function that we named <i>authorize</i>. We'll take a closer look at <i>authorize</i> in a moment, but first its important to note three things about <i>main</i>.
</p>
<p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>If <i>authorize</i> returns non-zero, the program will go off on a deep code path on which it is not immediately clear what will happen.</li>
  <li>If it returns zero, <i>main</i> informs the user that they entered the wrong password.</li>
  <li>The entire <i>main</i> function body appears to be wrapped in a <i>try</i>/<i>catch</i> block. This is evidenced by the floating, seemingly disconnected, basic blocks off to the side.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The string displayed both prior to calling <i>authorize</i> and when the return value is zero suggests that the program expects a password. However, the password isn't checked in <i>main</i> so we proceeded to examine <i>authorize</i>. The first basic block is shown below.
</p>
<br />
<p>
<span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 381.00px; height: 318.00px;">
<img alt="the first basic block of authorize" src="images/image02.png" style="width: 381.00px; height: 318.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="the first basic block of authorize">
</span>
</p>
<p>
Figure 3. the first basic block of <i>authorize</i>
</p>
<br />
<p>
Looking at the local variables the function, we saw a couple of stack buffers. Reading on further in the disassembly, we saw two calls to a function we called <i>do_some_reading</i>. That function takes three parameters: a file descriptor (zero in this case), a destination buffer, and a number of bytes to read. The astute reader might already see a problem (perhaps aided by our comments), but we'll forego that for a moment to finish reversing the function.
</p>
<br />
<p>
After reading the length-prefixed string, we saw a call to a subroutine which we determined implements the <i>memmem</i> function (a GNU extension). It's looking for the string "PASSWORD" inside the obtained data. 
If the substring is not found, the function prints an error message and returns. If it is found, The function then creates a SHA512 hash of the string starting 9 bytes in and compares it to a digest at <i>0x404448</i> (in the binary's <i>.rodata</i> section). The plaintext for the hash was easily obtained by simply Googling for it.
</p>
<br />
<p>
All said and done, supplying the correct string ("PASSWORD=wrong") caused <i>authorize</i> to return <b>1</b> to <i>main</i>. Upon returning, <i>main</i> provided you with an excellent monkey-themed ASCII art shown below in Figure 4.
</p>

</pre>

<p>
If you didn't specify the correct password or you put your guess in the wrong format, <i>authorize</i> returned <b>0</b> to <i>main</i> and you were told about your failure. Regardless of which output (art, bad pw, bad format) was displayed, the well-defined program flow disconnected you after.
Because either of these outcomes are largely worthless, we knew that we must have missed something. Obviously this was a red herring, but it was a fun one nevertheless. Thanks! Next, we turned our attention back at the two calls to <i>do_read_something</i>.
</p>

<h1>About the Bug</h1>
<p>
Remember from Figure 3 that there are two calls to <i>do_read_something</i>. The first reads a 32-bit integer value into a local variable which we named <i>v_int</i>. The second call uses <i>v_int</i> as the size of the data to read. It reads the data into a local fixed-size stack buffer of 1024 bytes. The issue is that there is no validation or sanitization done on the <i>v_int</i> in between. This results in a stack buffer overflow whenever a value larger than 1024 is specified. Ahh, the undefined behavior that we all know and love...
</p>
<br />
<p>
All in all, this bug was fairly easy to spot. The trick in this challenge was not finding the bug, but rather figuring out how to exploit it. The <i>authorize</i> function contains stack cookies, which throws a wrench in our proverbial machine. So what could we do?
</p>

<h1>Exploring Primitives</h1>
<p>
The next thing we did was to try various lengths of our favorite character (0x41). We started by over-writing just a small amount of data after the buffer. The following excerpt shows what we saw when we overwrote only 32 bytes beyond the buffer.
</p>
<pre>
$ ruby -e 'str = "A" * (1024+32); puts [str.length].pack("V") + str' | nc 54.197.145.219 666
If you guess the password, I will give you a reward!

<p>
This was pretty much expected since we saw some calls to <i>__stack_chk_fail</i>, which indicated that the stack was protected against buffer overflows. Seeing this information had an additional benefit for us. We could see quite a bit of information about the remote process's address space. We could clearly see that NX was enabled. By running this command a couple of times we were able to see that ASLR was enabled for all regions except the binary's base address. We confirmed this by looking at the binary too, just to be safe.
</p>
<pre>
$ execstack -q harry_potter
- harry_potter
$ readelf -a harry_potter | grep 'Type:'
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
</pre>
<p>
From these two commands we can see that the remote binary has a non-executable stack and does *NOT* have PIE enabled. This means we can at least count on the addresses within the binary to remain constant. This is a key factor in successfully exploiting this process.
</p>
<br />
<p>
At this point we spun up an environment to be able to debug the provided binary. We hypothesized that it was running under some kind of <i>inetd</i> setup since it didn't implement any socket functionality itself. We turned to <i>socat</i> to mimic <i>inetd</i>. The following two scripts did the job.
</p>
<pre>
$ cat listener.sh
#!/bin/sh
while true; do socat -lm TCP-LISTEN:6666,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:./start-harry_potter; done

$ cat start-harry_potter
#!/bin/sh
setsid ./harry_potter 2>&1

</pre>
<p>
With the ability to debug, we continued trying larger and larger overwrite lengths. Each time we saw a new crash we noted it and dug in to see what we could do with it.
</p>

<h2>Crash 1 - 1056 bytes</h2>
<p>
The first crash we saw occurred while unwinding the stack deep in the compiler runtime. It happens while generating the stack trace that is included in the cookie failure output. An excerpt from the debugging session follows:
</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
Although the value of <i>rcx</i> was completely controlled, getting full control from this crash didn't look easy. We tried several different values for <i>rcx</i>, which corresponded to saved <i>rip</i> values from previous frames. As long as the value was readable, it led to that value being printed in the stack trace. The algorithm stops when it reaches a NULL <i>rip</i>. When properly terminated, the rest of the error output was printed and the program was aborted as was expected due to the corrupted cookie. Without success, we continued to try larger strings.
</p>

<h2>Crash 2 - 1316 bytes</h2>
<p>
The next interesting crash happened when we used a string of 1316 bytes. An excerpt from the debugging session follows:
</p>

<p>
This crash was fairly interesting as it was trying to take the length of a string specified by a pointer under our control. It turns out that we corrupted the <i>argv[0]</i> of the program. We tried pointing it to the Global Offset Table (GOT) entry for the <i>read</i> function from <i>libc</i> and got the following:
</p>

As you can see from the output, we successfully leaked the value back to ourselves (in this case it was 0x7f74dba2dfd0). After printing this value out, the program crashed in the unwinding code again. We determined this context to be the same call stack as before, so we continued on.

<h2>Crash 3 - 1332 bytes</h2>
<p>
When passing only a few more bytes, we got a different crash. This time we crashed in the <i>getenv</i> function:

Like before, we crashed in code dealing with printing the stack corruption protection failure. This time we corrupted <i>environ[0]</i> . Controlling this means that we could influence several environment related settings. However, we determined none of them would get us closer to a shell. To avoid crashing here, we simply set the pointer value to NULL. After doing so, the crash in the unwinding code reappeared and we continued experimenting with longer lengths.
</p>

<h2>Crash 4 - >= 9224 bytes</h2>
<p>
After the crash inside <i>getenv</i>, we didn't get any more new crashes until we reached a rather large amount of data. An excerpt from the debugging session appears below.

This crash occurred inside libc code while initializing the heap. Looking deeper, it turned out to be related to the environment variables being corrupted. We could control these pointers, but it wasn't immediately clear how setting various flags for the heap implementation would yield a better primitive. As before, we set the pointer to NULL and tried again. This time, we got the following:
</p>

This time we didn't crash while allocating an exception. Rather, we crashed again inside unwinding code. However, this time it was called from <i>__cxa_throw</i> instead of <i>__stack_chk_fail</i>. We also noticed that the program was no longer printing the "BAD FORMAT" error. Instead it printed "EXCEPTION: Error during read". To get a better understanding, we took a closer look at the <i>do_read_something</i> function:
</p>
<br />
<p>
<span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 727.00px; height: 734.00px;">

</span>
</p>
<p>
Figure 5. control flow graph of <i>do_read_something</i>
</p>
<br />

<p>
This function loops trying to read data until one of two things happens: all of the expected data is successfully received or an error occurs. In the case that the latter happens, the function raises an exception using <i>throw</i>. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
In normal circumstances, there are only two ways to get <i>read</i> to fail. The first is to disconnect from the remote host. This is less than desirable, since we wanted to get a shell. Further, we knew that ASLR was in effect and thus we would need to leak some memory address too. The other, and more useful, method is to cause <i>read</i> to try to write to an invalid memory address. This was exactly what was happening when we sent more than 9224 bytes.
</p>
<br />
<p>
At this point, we were crashing with <i>rcx</i> fully controlled but weren't sure exactly what to set it to. On a whim, we tried setting it to the original return address value (the one there before we smashed it, 0x400f00). Then we got the following crash:
</p>
<pre>
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000000401001 in ?? ()
(gdb) x/i $pc
=> 0x401001:    retq
(gdb) x/gx $rsp
0x7fff304222e8: 0x4141414141414141
</pre>
<p>
This was MUCH better!! This is the type of crash one gets when the value about to be popped into <i>rip</i> by the <i>retq</i> instruction is not mapped. Setting it to a mapped value would redirect the flow of exection to the specified address. Thus, we had full control of <i>rip</i>. With such a primitive achieved, we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We moved towards building our payload that would give us a shell.
</p>


<h1>Getting a Shell</h1>
<p>
Despite having control of the program counter, we still needed to leak a memory address and use it in a subsequent additonal request. The general strategy was simply to execute <i>system("/bin/sh")</i>. If we could determine the <i>libc</i> binary used and obtain the address of something within then we could construct a payload to spawn a shell and thus obtain the key for the challenge.
</p>
<br />
<p>
First things first. We had to leak an address from <i>libc</i>. We already experimented with leaking the address of the <i>read</i> function before, so this was a logical choice. But how?
</p>
<br />
<p>
Looking again at <i>main</i> we saw an opportunity to re-use the code that printed the password prompt. We chose the location 0x400eee, which corresponds to the call to <i>std::ostream::operator&lt;&lt;</i> call in <i>main</i>. We quickly put together a small Return Oriented Programming (ROP) gadget sequence. We set the <i>rsi</i> and <i>read</i> registers to the addresses of <i>read</i> in the GOT and <i>std::cerr</i>, respectively. Testing the memory disclosure exploit successfully gave us the address we desired. The only limitation to this technique was that output would terminate at the first NUL byte. This caused problems on occasion (when the leaked address contained a NUL) but nothing running the exploit again couldn't solve. :)
</p>
<br />
<p>
What's more though, is that this exploit also happened to re-enter the vulnerable code -- allowing us to trigger the vulnerability again. This is exactly what we needed in order to utilize the information we just leaked. We refactored our exploit to send a secondary dynamic payload built on the leaked information. We tested it successfully locally but it didn't work against the challenge server. Ugh.
</p>

<h1>Improving Reliability</h1>
<p>
Getting the exploit working reliably against the challenge server turned out to be a bit of pain. Tracing locally showed that the data received by the second trigger of the vulnerability was somewhat non-deterministic. After some thought, we decided this was likely due to a subtle interaction between the way <i>stdin</i> buffers input and random space added at the bottom of the stack when a process is created. We mostly solved this by sending an initial payload with our ROP chain and then sending 8 bytes at a time until we received the "EXCEPTION" message. Then we could read the leaked data, craft our secondary exploit payload, and send it along reliably. After making these changes, we ran the exploit against the challenge server and obtained a shell.
</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
This challenge was very interesting and required devising new exploitation techniques to bypass exploit mitigations. The technique showcased was likely known by very few people at the time. Although this technique only applies in specific circumstances, it none-the-less advances the state of the art in exploitation. Those well versed in Windows exploitation will be quick to see similarities between this technique and the venerable SEH bypass technique. Mix in a few subtle complications stemming from non-deterministism and buffering and it's clear to see why the point value for this challenge was increased during the game. A+++ will hack again!
